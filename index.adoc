== *About the Practical Course*

*Tuesday, May 30, 2023 - Thursday, June 1, 2023* +
The use of a single reference genome in bioinformatics can lead to reference bias and miss important information about genome variability and relationships. New assembly methods have made it easier to generate high-quality complete genome assemblies, and using a pangenome graph that expresses many genomes and their mutual alignment can help address these issues. This course will focus on building such graphs from whole genome assemblies and using them in various downstream applications in comparative genomics, evolution, variation analysis, sequence alignment, and phenotype association.

Participants will learn about pangenome concepts and gain practical experience building and analyzing pangenome graphs. They will apply these methods to complex research questions that require understanding the relationships between multiple genomes or accounting for variability when analyzing new genomes. By the end of the course, participants will have a strong understanding of pangenome methods based on whole genome assemblies.


== *About the Virtual Conference*

*Friday, June 2, 2023* +
We will gather for a hybrid in-person and virtual conference on the last day of the week.
This will bring together course participants and virtual and in-person speakers who are actively working on diverse aspects of pangenome research.
The virtual meeting will be open to the public.
Speakers will cover topics at the intersection of pangenome methods and biology, including a focus on basic methods, data structures, genome assembly, data visualization, and public collaborative pangenome projects.
We expect to draw speakers from a diverse set of species contexts.

=== *Practical Course Instructors*

==== Erik Garrison - Assistant Professor

.[purple]#University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN, US#

image:images/erik.jpeg[erik,200,role="right"] Genomicist with a quantitative social science background. I build methods that let us understand the precise relationships between thousands of genomes. In these, the genome is encoded in a graph that may represent a population sample of individuals from the same species, a metagenome, the diploid genome of a single individual, or any other useful collection of sequences.

=== *Selection criteria*

This course is intended for biologists and bioinformaticians interested in studying organisms with high genetic diversity or without a reference genome, as well as those involved in comparative genomics and the assembly of pangenomes for any species.

Selection of participants will be based on:

- good knowledge of Linux operating system and basic shell commands. This will be a mandatory prerequisite.
- familiarity with genomics data formats (e.g., FASTA, VCF, BED, ...) is a plus.
- impact of the course for the participant and his/her research group.
- stage of the research project: priority will be given to participants with data already available and ready to be analyzed (participants data will not be analyzed during the course).

Fulfillment of these conditions by participants will be assessed through the registration form.
