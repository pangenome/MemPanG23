== *About the Practical Course (Tuesday, May 30th - Thursday, June 1st 2023)*

The use of a single reference genome in bioinformatics can lead to reference bias and miss important information about genome variability and relationships. New assembly methods have made it easier to generate high-quality complete genome assemblies, and using a pangenome graph that expresses many genomes and their mutual alignment can help address these issues. This course will focus on building such graphs from whole genome assemblies and using them in various downstream applications in comparative genomics, evolution, variation analysis, sequence alignment, and phenotype association.

=== Erik Garrison-Assistant Professor

.[purple]#University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN, US#

image:images/erik.jpeg[erik,200,role="right"] Genomicist with a quantitative social science background. Harvard undergrad, Cambridge PhD. I build methods that let us understand the precise relationships between thousands of genomes. My work on this topic began with the development of Bayesian methods to detect and genotype genomic variants, with application of these methods to the thousands of human genomes cataloged in the 1000 Genomes Project. Lessons learned in that effort guided me to work on unbiased methods for genome inference based on graphical models of pangenomes. In these, the genome is encoded in a graph that may represent a population sample of individuals from the same species, a metagenome, the diploid genome of a single individual, or any other useful collection of genomic sequence information. I have shown that this approach provides more accurate alignment of reads when it is possible to construct a high-quality pangenome, and am currently applying it to the construction of pangenome graphs for humans as part of the HPRC.

=== Andrea Guarracino-Postdoctoral Scholar

.[purple]#University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN, US#

image:images/andrea.jpeg[erik,200,role="right"]I am bioinformatician dedicated to the development and application of new methods to analyze collections of sequences (also called pangenomes). After a degree in computer engineering and an experience in a software company, he met biology by chance and fell in love with it. He then decided to pursue a master's degree in bioinformatics and then a PhD in the same field. During my doctorate, I explored chromosomal instability in colorectal cancer stem cells for the development of novel therapeutic approaches. In the middle of his research, "thanks" to the pandemic, I attended a virtual event where he encountered pangenomics and began actively working on developing new tools for building and analyzing pangenomes, which I am still currently doing.
